    <h4>Observe the diagram to the bottom. It outlines the overall setup of your DNS records within Route 53 (amazon.com
    service):</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>You purchased a custom domain name through a Domain Registrar, which in this case, is Route 53.</li>
      <li>Four unique name servers were assigned to your custom domain name after your purchase.</li>
      <li>To assign your custom domain name to your web site, you had to set up a Hosted Zone with multiple DNS records
        for your custom domain name. The Hosted Zone was set up within Route 53.
      </li>
      <li>Inside of the Hosted Zone, the NS record was created automatically for you by Route 53. However, you created
        the A record and the CNAME record.
      </li>
      <li>This setup allows you to visit your personal website with your new custom domain name, even though it's hosted
        on GitHub!
      </li>
    </ol>
