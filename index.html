  <h1>This page is related to deploying static website to public Internet using GitHub pages</h1>
  <h2>(the basic scheme for deploying is <a href="deploy-model.html" target="_blank">here</a>)</h2>
  <h3>Note that this is handy tool <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> used to generate static sites</h3>

  <h3>Let's see how to deploy website step by step:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>First of all we need content</li>
    <p>We can create site content from scratch (like this website) or use special tools (like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>)</p>
    
    <li>Once we created a content we can publish it using GitHub Pages</li>
    <p>GitHub Pages is a service offered by GitHub. Specifically, GitHub Pages are public webpages that are hosted and published through GitHub.</p>
    <p>Why GitHub Pages? GitHub Pages offers extensive integration and support for Jekyll.
    By using both, you'll benefit from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Easy setup</li>
      <li>Troubleshooting your site</li>
      <li>Updating and maintaining your site</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Remember, it is possible to follow all of the steps with your own content â€”
      just make sure that your HTML is inside of a file called index.html (a GitHub Pages requirement).
    </p>
    
    <li>Make repository on GitHub</li>
    <p>Specifically, the repo's name must be in the following format: <strong>your-user-name.github.io</strong></p>

  </ol>
